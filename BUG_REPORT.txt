CRITICAL ISSUES
================================================================================

1. CONSOLE ERROR - 404 Resource Not Found
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Location: Home Page
   Description: Console shows "Failed to load resource: the server responded 
                with a status of 404 (Not Found)"
   Impact: May affect production deployment or missing assets
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Open home page
   2. Check browser console
   3. Observe 404 error
   Recommendation: Identify and fix missing resource or remove reference

================================================================================

================================================================================

None identified

================================================================================
MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES
================================================================================

2. React Router Future Flag Warnings
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Location: All pages
   Description: Two React Router warnings in console:
                - v7_startTransition flag warning
                - v7_relativeSplatPath flag warning
   Impact: Code will break when upgrading to React Router v7
   Recommendation: Add future flags to router configuration in src/main.tsx:
   
   const router = createBrowserRouter(routes, {
     basename,
     future: {
       v7_startTransition: true,
       v7_relativeSplatPath: true
     }
   })
